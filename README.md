# RayTracing_Project
Sabanci University Fall 2020-2021 CS 405 Computer Graphics course Ray Tracing Project code and renders

In this project, the aim is to develop a ray tracer. Ray tracing is a rendering technique that can produce incredibly realistic lighting effects. Essentially, an algorithm can trace the path of light, and then simulate the way that the light interacts with the virtual objects it ultimately hits in the computer-generated world. 

For this project, I developed a separate code for each of the tasks asked. 

I used C++ in this project and used OpenGL Mathematics (GLM). It also includes the report that I have written that explains how I have achieved that task.
